This R script was developed to study the effect of data variability in enzyme kinetics studies using Monte Carlo simulation.

The data displayed in this script is for a Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics profile and the kinetic parameters and substrate concentration were created based on studies we have performed in our laboratory.

The experimental design used in this simulation calculated the initial rate (v0) by subtracting the final substrate concentration quantified in the metabolism samples after incubation (Sf) from the initial substrate concentration (S) dividing by the protein concentration in the incubation (cprot) and incubation time (tinc). 

Feel free to change the enzyme kinetic parameters and the relative standard deviation (rsd) to observe their effect in the data.
